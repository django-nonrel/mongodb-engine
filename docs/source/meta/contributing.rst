How to Contribute
=================

We'd love to see you getting involved in Django MongoDB Engine's development!

Here are some ideas on how you can help evolve this project:

* :ref:`Send us feedback <contributing/mailinglist>`! Tell us about your good or bad
  experiences with Django MongoDB Engine -- what did you like and what should be improved?
* Blog/write about using Django with MongoDB and
  :ref:`let us know about your work <contributing/mailinglist>`.
* Help solving other people's problems on :ref:`the mailing list <contributing/mailinglist>`.
* Fix and improve this documentation. Since none of the Django MongoDB Engine
  developers are native speakers, these documents are probably full of typos and
  weird, ungrammatical phrasings.  Also, if you're missing something from this
  documentation, please tell us!
* :ref:`Report bugs and feature requests <contributing/bugreports>`.
* :ref:`Send patches or pull requests <contributing/patches>` containing bug
  fixes, new features or code improvement.
