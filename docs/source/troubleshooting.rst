Troubleshooting
===============

This page is going to be a collection of common issues Django MongoDB Engine
users faced. Please help grow this collection --
:doc:`tell us about your troubles <meta/contributing>`!


.. _troubleshooting/SITE_ID:

``SITE_ID`` issues
------------------
.. code-block:: none

   AutoField (default primary key) values must be strings representing an ObjectId on MongoDB (got u'1' instead). Please make sure your SITE_ID contains a valid ObjectId string.

This means that your ``SITE_ID`` setting (`What's SITE_ID?!`_) is incorrect --
it is set to "1" but the site object that has automatically been created has an
ObjectId primary key.

If you add ``'django_mongodb_engine'`` to your list of ``INSTALLED_APPS``, you
can use the ``tellsiteid`` command to get the default site's ObjectId and update
your ``SITE_ID`` setting accordingly:

.. code-block:: none

   $ ./manage.py tellsiteid
   The default site's ID is u'deafbeefdeadbeef00000000'. To use the sites framework, add this line to settings.py:
   SITE_ID=u'deafbeefdeadbeef00000000'

.. _What's SITE_ID?!: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-SITE_ID


Creating/editing user in admin causes ``DatabaseError``
-------------------------------------------------------
.. code-block:: none

   DatabaseError at /admin/auth/user/deafbeefdeadbeef00000000/
   [...] This query is not supported by the database.

This happens because Django tries to execute JOINs in order to display a list of
groups/permissions in the user edit form.

To workaround this problem, add ``'djangotoolbox'`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
which makes the Django admin skip the groups and permissions widgets.


No form field implemented for <class 'djangotoolbox.fields.ListField'>

How can I log the MongoDB queries made by Django?
-------------------------------------------------
You can simply use Django's `query logging system <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/logging/#django-db-backends>`_. 
An example configuration can be found `here <https://github.com/django-nonrel/mongodb-engine/blob/8348371be5779dafe8cb47d54f8337fe17b27bdc/tests/settings/debug.py#L5>`_.
